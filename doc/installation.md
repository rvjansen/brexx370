# Installation Guide

## Introduction

This document covers the installation process of BREXX/370.

BREXX/370 is provided as-is, please test carefully in test systems only!

BREXX/370 is not the same as IBM’s REXX; there are many similarities,
but also differences, especially when using MVS-specific functions.

Rob Prins’ TK5 Update 3 includes an installed version of BREXX/370.

## Prerequisites

### MVS TK4- / MVS/CE

This version of BREXX/370 has been developed and tested within Jürgen
Winkelmann’s TK4- ([https://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/](https://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/)). It also comes
pre-installed in MVS/CE ([https://github.com/MVS-sysgen/sysgen](https://github.com/MVS-sysgen/sysgen)). It may
work in other versions of MVS, such as [https://www.jaymoseley.com/hercules/installMVS/iSYSGENv7.htm](https://www.jaymoseley.com/hercules/installMVS/iSYSGENv7.htm)
but can’t be guaranteed.

### MVS TK5 (update 3)

This version of BREXX/370 was tested on Rob Prins’ TK5. It will be included in
TK5 (update 03). Therefore, you can skip the installation process unless you
update your BREXX installation with a fix release.

### Other MVS distributions

It should work with other MVS distributions, but this cannot be verified.
Users should be aware of the following differences:

#### XMIT RECEIVE STEPLIB DD Statement

It might be necessary to add a STEPLIB DD statement to locate the
library containing the RECV370:

```jcl
//RECV370  EXEC PGM=RECV370
//STEPLIB  DD   DSN=library
```

Please add it to the Jobs where needed.

In TK4- and TK5 RECV370 is contained in a system library; therefore, a
STEPLIB DD statement is not needed! On MVS/CE RECV370 is located in
SYSC.LINKLIB.

#### REGION SIZE

It may be necessary to lower the REGION size parameter to 4 MB or 6 MB, as MVS
may reject the REGION=8192K argument with the warning REGION UNAVAILABLE, ERROR
CODE=20. TK4-, MVS/CE, and TK5 support 8MB region sizes.

```jcl
//stepname EXEC PGM=xxxxx,REGION=6144K
```

### TSO fullscreen support

BREXX/370 supports and operates effectively in the following TSO full-screen
environments:

- Wally McLaughlin’s version of ISPF
- Greg Price’s REVIEW and RFE (Review Front End)
- Rob Prins’ RPF environment

### Recommendations

We recommend testing BREXX/370 in an isolated test system to avoid any
impact on your current system. To achieve this, you can easily copy the
entire Hercules/MVS directory to another location and install BREXX/370
there.

## Preparation of your target MVS38J System

### BREXX Catalogue

In TK5, the required Catalogue entry is already defined in the distribution
and can therefore be omitted.

Make sure that your MVS system has a BREXX Alias pointing to a user
catalogue defined in the master catalogue. To determine it, run the
command:

```default
listcat entries('brexx') all
```

The result must look like this:

```default
ALIAS --------- BREXX
     IN-CAT --- SYS1.VSAM.MASTER.CATALOG
     HISTORY
       RELEASE----------------2
     ASSOCIATIONS
       USERCAT--UCPUB001
```

If the BREXX Alias is not defined, add it:

```jcl
//ADDBREXX EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN    DD *
  DEFINE ALIAS (NAME(BREXX) RELATE(your-user-catalog))
```

If the submitted job is not running, it might be necessary to enter the
password of the master-catalogue in the MVS console (in TK4- not
needed).

If you omit this step, all BREXX data sets are catalogued in the Master
Catalog. In this case, it may require the use of the Master Catalog
password during the catalogue process. If you are running TK4- you do
not see such requests as RAKF is providing the access authorisation of
the Master Catalog, which therefore is not password protected. In the
default TK4- configuration, only users HERC01 and HERC02 are authorised
to update the master catalogue.

Make sure that dataset BREXX.V2R5M3.INSTALL is not already catalogued
from a previous run. It is the recommended dataset name and will be
created during the receiving process of RECV370.

## Installation

### Step 0 - Unzip BREXX/370 Installation File

The ZIP installation file consists of several files:

- BREXX370_Users_guide.pdf - This user guide
- BREXX370_RELEASE.XMIT - XMIT File containing BREXX modules and
  Installation JCL

### Step 1 - Upload XMIT File

Use the appropriate upload facility of your terminal emulation. Such as
IND$FILE or using rdrprep and inline JCL.

The file created during upload must have RECFM FB and LRECL 80. If
the DCB does not match, the subsequent unpacking process fails.

### Step 2 - Unpack XMIT File

Unpack the XMIT file with an appropriate JCL. If you don’t have one you
can use the following sample, just cut and paste it in one of your
JCL libraries.

```jcl
//BRXXREC JOB 'XMIT RECEIVE',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H
//* ------------------------------------------------------------
//* RECEIVE XMIT FILE AND CREATE DSN OR PDS
//* ------------------------------------------------------------
//RECV370  EXEC PGM=RECV370,REGION=8192K
//RECVLOG  DD SYSOUT=*
//XMITIN   DD DSN=HERC01.BREXX.V2R5M3.XMIT,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1   DD DSN=&&XMIT2,
//         UNIT=3390,
//         SPACE=(TRK,(300,60)),
//         DISP=(NEW,DELETE,DELETE)
//SYSUT2   DD DSN=BREXX.V2R5M3.INSTALL,
//         UNIT=3390,
//         SPACE=(TRK,(300,60,20)),
//         DISP=(NEW,CATLG,CATLG)
//SYSIN DD DUMMY
```

- **HERC01.UPLOAD.XMIT** represents the uploaded XMIT File - please change
  it accordingly to the name you have chosen during the upload process.
- **BREXX.V2R5M3.INSTALL** is the name of the unpacked library (created
  during the UNPACK process). It is recommendable to remain with this
  DSN as it is used in later processes. **Make sure there is no previous
  version of this PDS catalogued.**

Once the submitted job has successfully unpacked the XMIT file into the
target PDS, you can proceed with STEP 3. The created library
BREXX.V2R5M3.INSTALL contains all JCL to pursue with unpacking and
installing.

The next steps make usage of the unpacked library (in this example
BREXX.V2R5M3.INSTALL)

Please run the JCL in the given order (refer to the **Step x** reference
in the table). Submit Step 3 as the first JCL of the installation
sequence. Entries without a Step reference are used from the JCLs as
input datasets.

| Filename   | Description                                       | Used in Step   |

#### Activating the new BREXX Release

The next steps describe how to enable your new BREXX Release. In
summary, you must run the following jobs out of the above library in
the listed sequence:

- **$UNPACK** - mandatory
- **$INSTALL** - mandatory
- **$TESTRX** - optional, recommended
- **$CREKEYV** - optional, recommended
- **$CLEANUP** - optional

See details in the step descriptions below.

### Step 3 - Submit $UNPACK JCL of the unpacked Library

In the unpacking process, the contained installation files will be
expanded into different partitioned datasets.

If you followed the dataset naming recommendations it is:
**BREXX.V2R5M3.INSTALL** and no change is required.

```jcl
//BRXXUNP JOB 'XMIT UNPACK',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H,NOTIFY=&SYSUID
//*
//* ------------------------------------------------------------------
//* UNPACK XMIT FILES INTO INSTALL LIBRARIES
//*   *** CHANGE XMITLIB= TO THE EXPANDED XMIT LIBRARY OF INSTALLATION
//* ------------------------------------------------------------------
//*           ---->   CHANGE XMITLIB TO YOUR UNPACKED XMIT FILE  <----
//*                          XXXXXXXXXXX
//*                         X     X     X
//*                        X      X      X
//*                       X       X       X
//*                      X        X        X
//XMITLOAD PROC XMITLIB='BREXX.V2R5M3.INSTALL',
//         HLQ='BREXX.V2R5M3',     <-- DO NOT CHANGE HLQ ----
//         MEMBER=
```

After completion of the $UNPACK JCL the following new Libraries are
available:

The unpacking process removes any old version of the above libraries,
before the creation of the new version. If no old version of these
libraries is available, the delete steps end with RC=4, as well as the
job ends with RC=4. **Ignore these errors**, if the individual
unpack steps return with RC=0. Therefore please carefully check the
output of this job.

With the authorised version you can call from BREXX utilities as
IEBGENER, IEBCOPY, NJE38, etc. which run in authorised mode. This
requires that the environment in which you start BREXX is authorised,
meaning Wally Mclaughlin’s ISPF, or RFE must be authorised.
Plain TSO is already authorised.

Both installations are copied into the same partitioned datasets;
they are, therefore, mutually exclusive!

If the standard installation is sufficient, continue with **Step 4** If you
plan to use the authorised, continue with **Step 4A**. In this case, the
MVS authorisation table needs to be updated as well.

### Step 4 - Submit $INSTALL JCL for the Standard Installation

The **$INSTALL** JCL copies all member from the following two
partitioned datasets into the appropriate SYS2 datasets.

- BREXX.V2R5M3.LINKLIB -> SYS2.LINKLIB
- BREXX.V2R5M3.PROCLIB -> SYS2.PROCLIB

All these members are BREXX/370 specific and do not conflict with
existing members. Members of the system libraries remain untouched.

**Continue with STEP 5**

### Step 4A- Submit $INSTAPF JCL for the Authorised Installation

The $INSTPAPF JCL copies all member from the following two
partitioned datasets into the appropriate SYS2 datasets.

- BREXX.V2R5M3.LINKLIB -> SYS2.LINKLIB
- BREXX.V2R5M3.PROCLIB -> SYS2.PROCLIB

All these members are BREXX/370 specific and do not conflict with
existing members. Members of the system libraries remain untouched.

To authorise the Modules to change the following Modules:

```default
SYS1.UMODSRC(IKJEFTE2)
SYS1.UMODSRC(IKJEFTE8)
```

Add the BREXX modules to the sources:

```default
     DC    C'BREXX   '             BREXX/370
     DC    C'REXX    '             BREXX/370
     DC    C'RX      '             BREXX/370
```

To activate the changes submit the Jobs:

- SYS1.UMODCNTL(ZUM0001)
- SYS1.UMODCNTL(ZUM0014)

Aftewards you **must** restart your MVS:

- Shut down your MVS
- Re-IPL your job with the CLPA option
- Shut Down MVS again
- Perform normal IPL

### Step 5 - Submit $TESTRX JCL of the unpacked Library

Submit $TESTRX start a test to verify the installation of BREXX/370.
All steps should return with RC=0

### Step 6 - Create the Key/Value Database (optional)

If you want to use Key/Value function in BREXX, modify and submit $CREKEYV.
This JCL contains two CREATE CLUSTER definitions for the required VSAM
datasets. As the K/V Database may contain data from many applications, it is
generously sized, adjust it to a size which suits you. It is recommended to
allocate it on a separate VOLUME, but not mandatory, insert the one chosen one.

Once it is created you can use it with the Key/Value functions.

Key/Value Database:

```default
DEFINE CLUSTER                           -
         (NAME(BREXX.KEYVALUE)           -
          INDEXED                        -
          KEYS(44 0)                     -
          RECORDSIZE(64 8192)            -
          SHAREOPTIONS(2,3)              -
          CYLINDERS(600 50)              -
          VOLUMES(XXXXXX)                -
          UNIQUE                         -
          SPEED)                         -
       DATA                              -
          (NAME(BREXX.KEYVALUE.DATA))    -
       INDEX                             -
          (NAME(BREXX.KEYVALUE.INDEX))
```

Reference Database:

```default
DEFINE CLUSTER                           -
         (NAME(BREXX.KEYREFS)            -
          INDEXED                        -
          KEYS(105 0)                    -
          RECORDSIZE(128 512)            -
          SHAREOPTIONS(2,3)              -
          CYLINDERS(250 50)              -
          VOLUMES(XXXXXX)                -
          UNIQUE                         -
          SPEED)                         -
       DATA                              -
          (NAME(BREXX.KEYREFS.DATA))     -
       INDEX                             -
          (NAME(BREXX.KEYREFS.INDEX))
```

### Step 7 - Submit $CLEANUP JCL of the unpacked Library

The $CLEANUP job removes all unnecessary installation files they are no
longer needed, as they were merged into the appropriate SYS2.xxx
library.

- BREXX.V2R5M3.LINKLIB
- BREXX.V2R5M3.PROCLIB

You may also wish to remove the uploaded XMIT File, which was used for
the first unpack process.

### Step 8 - ADD BREXX Libraries into TSO Logon

To run BREXX with its shortcut RX, REXX, BREXX you must allocate the
BREXX libraries into your Logon procedure. There are several ways to
achieve this. The easiest and recommended method for TK4 users is to
add lines into SYS1.CMDPROC(USRLOGON). Non TK4 installation may use
different libraries. MVS/CE and Jay Moseley sysgen use
SYS1.CMDPROC(TSOLOGON).

```default
/* ALLOCATE RXLIB IF PRESENT */
IF &SYSDSN('BREXX.V2R5M3.RXLIB') EQ &STR(OK) THEN DO
  FREE FILE(RXLIB)
  ALLOC FILE(RXLIB) +
    DSN('BREXX.V2R5M3.RXLIB') SHR

/* ALLOCATE SYSEXEC TO SYS2 EXEC */
IF &SYSDSN('SYS2.EXEC') EQ &STR(OK) THEN DO
 FREE FILE(SYSEXEC)
 ALLOC FILE(SYSEXEC) DSN('SYS2.EXEC') SHR
END

/* ALLOCATE SYSUEXEC TO USER EXECS */
IF &SYSDSN('&SYSUID..EXEC') EQ &STR(OK) THEN DO
 FREE FILE(SYSUEXEC)
 ALLOC FILE(SYSUEXEC) DSN('&SYSUID..EXEC') SHR
END
```

insert the clist above before the line %STDLOGON in
SYS1.CMDPROC(USRLOGON).

**The update of the TSO Logon CLIST is an entirely manual process!**
Please take a backup of USRLOGON / TSOLOGON CLIST first to allow a recovery in
case of errors!

Using the CLISTs as plain commands, you can either copy them into the user
clist or allocate BREXX.V2R5M3.CMDLIB in the appropriate TSO start clist.
This may be accomplished in TK4, MVS/CE and TK5 by including the following part
in SYS1.CMDPROC(USRLOGON) / SYS1.CMDPROC(TSOLOGON):

```default
FREE FILE(SYSPROC)
ALLOC FILE(SYSPROC) +
  DSN('&SYSUID..CMDPROC','SYS1.CMDPROC','SYS2.CMDPROC', -
      'SYS2.REVIEW.CLIB','BREXX.V2R5M3.CMDLIB') SHR
```

### Step 9 - Your Tests

It is advised to LOGOFF and LOGON again to your system to make sure that
the newly installed modules become active.

Now it’s your turn to test BREXX/370! Please be advised BREXX/370 is
not z/OS REXX, so you might miss some functions but find also functions
not available in the “original”.

### Step 9 - Remove old BREXX Libraries (optional)

If you had a previous BREXX/370 version installed and your tests ran
successfully, you can remove the libraries of the earlier BREXX version,
for example, V2R2M0.

If you upgraded from the very first BREXX/370 version, you can remove
the following libraries:

| Dataset           | Description             |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **BREXX.CMDLIB**  | REXX commands           |
| **BREXX.SAMPLE**  | REXX Samples scripts    |
| **BREXX.JCL**     | REXX Job Control        |
| **BREXX.LINKLIB** | BREXX Load Modules      |
| **BREXX.PROCLIB** | BREXX JCL Procedures    |
| **BREXX.RXLIB**   | BREXX include Libraries |

## Additional Settings (optional)

If you want to communicate with the control program of the host system
(either Hercules or VM) you can do so, by running:

```default
ADDRESS COMMAND 'CP cp-parameter ...'
```

For VM you need to use a valid CP command. Example:

```default
ADDRESS COMMAND 'CP QUERY TIME'
```

If your system is running within Hercules your CP commands are routed
to Hercules and need to be Hercules commands. Example:

```default
ADDRESS COMMAND 'CP DEVLIST'
```

To communicate with Hercules you need to enable the DIAG8 commands
DIAG8CMD ENABLE in the Hercules console. In TK4-, TK5, and MVS/CE systems it is
already enabled. If it is not enabled and you run an
ADDRESS COMMAND “CP command” BREXX will abend typically with an 0C6.

# Useful functions

There are JCL Procedures delivered, which facilitate the test and
execution of REXX scripts. The installation process merges them
into SYS2.PROCLIB.

The delivered RXLIB PDS contains several REXX functions, which are
usable as if they were a BREXX internal function.

The delivered JCL procedures allocate the RXLIB library, and it is
recommended to add it also into the TSO Logon procedures (Step 8).

## TSO online

Executing rexx scripts in TSO uses either RX or REXX. You can either
call scripts from dataset libraries or fully qualified dataset names.

To call a script from a library:

```default
RX rexx-script-name
REXX rexx-script-name
```

BREXX performs all necessary allocations. It is advised to add a
user-specific REXX library, naming convention: &SYSUID.EXEC (RECFM=VB,
LRECL255). If available, the REXX-script searches path starts from
there. The REXX library search sequence is:

1. SYSUEXEC - typically &SYSUID.EXEC
2. SYSUPROC - (optional)
3. SYSEXEC - (optional)
4. SYSPROC - (optional)

At least one of these libraries needs to be pre-allocated during the
TSO logon process. It is not mandatory to have all of them allocated.
It depends on your planned REXX development environment. The
allocations may consist of concatenated datasets. If you followed the
instructions above then SYSEXEC is assigned to SYS2.EXEC and SYSUEXEC
is assigned to &SYSUID.EXEC.

Alternatively, you can specify a fully qualified dataset-name and
member name (if the dataset is a PDS):

```default
RX 'dataset-name(rexx-script-name)'
REXX 'dataset(rexx-script-name)'
```

## TSO Batch (start REXX JCL Procedure)

There is a JCL Procedure defined that allows you to run REXX Scripts in
a TSO Batch environment. The Procedure performs all necessary BREXX and
TSO allocations.

Some ADDRESS TSO commands as ALLOC/FREE are supported.

```jcl
//DATETEST JOB CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H,REGION=8192K,NOTIFY=&SYSUID
//*
//* ------------------------------------------------------------------*
//* TEST REXX DATE AS TSO BATCH
//* ------------------------------------------------------------------*
//REXX EXEC RXTSO,EXEC='DATE#T',SLIB='BREXX.V2R5M3.SAMPLES'
```

- **EXEC=** defines the rexx script to run
- **SLIB=** defines the library/partitioned dataset containing the
  rexx script defined in **EXEC**

Additionally, you can add a P=’input-parameters’ JCL Parameter field,
if your rexx receives input parameters.

### TSO CLISTs

To use the Clists of BREXX.V2R5M3.CMDLIB without an EXEC command, the
library must be allocated to TSO, alternatively, you can copy the members to an
allocated library (e.g.  SYS2.CMDPROC)-

### Plain Batch (start REXX JCL Procedure)

There is a JCL Procedure defined that allows you to run REXX Scripts in
a plain Batch environment. The Procedure performs all necessary BREXX allocations

#### WARNING
**ADDRESS TSO** commands are not supported here!

```jcl
//DATETEST JOB CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H,REGION=8192K,NOTIFY=&SYSUID
//*
//* ------------------------------------------------------------------*
//* TEST REXX DATE AS TSO BATCH
//* ------------------------------------------------------------------*
//REXX EXEC RXBATCH,EXEC='ETIME#T',SLIB='BREXX.SAMPLES'
```

- **EXEC=** defines the rexx script to run
- **SLIB=** defines the library/partitioned dataset containing the
  rexx script defined in **EXEC**

Additionally, you can add a P=’input-parameters’ JCL Parameter field,
if your rexx receives input parameters.

### BREXX/370 Sample Library

The Library BREXX.version.SAMPLES contains a variety of REXX scripts
that cover the following areas:

- Basic functionality in Members starting with ‘$’
- FSS samples, starting with ‘#’
- VSAM samples beginning with ‘@’
- All other scripts are original samples delivered with Vasilis
  Vlachoudis BREXX installation.

### BREXX/370 Hints

- Make sure your REXX files do not have line numbers! They are not wiped away
  by BREXX/370 and are thus considered script content. This causes mistakes
  during interpretation, and occasionally even system abends! To disable line
  numbering and delete existing numbers, use UNNUM as a primary command in the
  RFE or RPF Editor.
- If the BREXX/370 call leads to an S106 Abend, the most likely reason is the
  creation of a new extent in SYS2.LINKLIB during the installation process. Its
  size and number of extents are loaded during IPL and kept while MVS is up and
  running. The creation of new extents will therefore not be discovered.
  - You can either re-IPL your system or better
  - REORG SYS2.LINKLIB with IEBCOPY
