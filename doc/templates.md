# Templates for ARG, PULL, and PARSE

The PULL, ARG and PARSE instructions use a template to parse a
string.

The simplest template is a list of variables where each of them is
assigned one word from the string, except the last variable in the list
which will contain the rest of the string.

```default
 PARSE VALUE "one two three four " WITH a b c
 now a="one"; b="two"; c="three four"
 PARSE VALUE "one two three four " WITH a b c d e
 now a="one"; b="two"; c="three"; d="four" and e=""
```

A dot ‘.’ can be in the place of one or more variables, it is used as a
place-holder.

```rexx
 PARSE VALUE "one two three four " WITH a . . d
 now a="one"
 d="four"
```

A more complex parsing is to use patterns for triggering:

- **number** which specifies an absolute position in string 1 - is the
  first character in string
- **=(name)** as a position may be a variable enclosed in parenthesis
  after an equal symbol
- **[+|-]number** signed numbers are used as a relative positioning
  > ```default
  > PARSE VALUE "one two three four " WITH 2 a 6 b
  > now a="ne t"; b="wo three four " pos=6;
  > PARSE VALUE "one two three four " WITH 2 a =(pos) b
  > now a="ne t"; b="wo three four " PARSE VALUE "one two three four " WITH 2 a +2 b
  > now a="ne"; b=" two three four "
  > ```
- **string** - may be used as a target position.
  > ```rexx
  >  PARSE VALUE "marmita/bill/vivi' WITH a '/' b '/' c
  > ```

  > now a=”marmita”; b=”bill”; c=”vivi”
- **(name)** - also as a target may be used a variable encolsed in parenthesis
  > ```rexx
  >  t = "%%"
  >  PARSE VALUE "aabbcc%%ddeeff%%gg%%" WITH . (t) middle (t) . now middle="ddeeff"
  > ```

A **comma** can be used as a “trigger” to move to the next string when
there is more than one to be parsed (e.g. when there is more than one
argument string to a routine).

```rexx
 CALL MyProc 'Hi',3,4
 EXIT
 MyProc:
 PARSE ARG first, second, third      /* now first="Hi" */
 ...         /* second=3 */
 /* third=4 */
```
